<h1>My work: Chemistry and Biology</h1>

<h2>So, what kind of work do you do?</h2>
<p>First, if you're an employer, make sure to check out <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1AYE2IV27d2XwRS79inSeWJX9dIB39u1c" target="_blank" download>my CV.</a> I'm not currently looking for a job right now,
but if you wanted to give me pointers that would be neat. That document is <em>way more formal</em> than this personal website. Check it out! This page is more of a deep dive into what it is exactly that I do, and hopefully it will show off my accomplishments.</p>
<h2>My work in the Patterson Lab</h2>
<p>I work as an undergraduate researcher in <a href="https://www.thepattersonlab.com/"> The Patterson Lab</a> at UCI. My lab is filled with some super cool people who do super cool research, you should check us out! </p>
<p> The grad students in the Patterson Lab work with a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), which is a microscope that uses electrons instead of light in order to see things smaller than light can bounce off of, such as atoms and molecular organization. Our lab mostly studies soft materials, which are those materials most influenced by the forces of brownian motion.
Think soap particles, oil blobs, and gels. These materials can be used for medical and industrial purposes, and  studying their structure is very important. However, undergraduates are not allowed on the TEM, so I study the synthesis and structure of Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) instead.</p>
<h4>Hold on... what are MOFs?</h4>
<p>MOFs are essentially super porous crystalline materials assembled through coordination chemistry, which basically means that the bonds holding the material together are a special kind of bond that is important for chemistry reasons.
These materials are made out of a metal "node" and an organic "linker", which bridges the nodes. The bonds holding a MOF together are weaker than those holding a rock or a molecule together, and this leads to very interesting uses. Many MOFs have very large pores, and this allows for them to be used in things such as gas storage and drug delivery, since the pores protect encapsulated material from harmful outside forces that would degrade or destroy the cargo in the MOF.
There are over 25,000 MOFs, assembled out of every kind of transition metal node and multidentate (at least two binding site) organic linker, each with different properties. My lab works with a special kind of MOF called ZIFs, which stands for Zeolitic Imidazole Framework.
</p>
<!--OMG ADD IN SOME COOL IMAGE TABS!!!-->
<p> ZIFs are important materials because they behave very similar to a material already in use called zeolites; hence, zeolitic. The zeolitic nature of ZIFs is a consequence of their structure: the organic linker is an organic molecule called imidazole.
This molecule is relatively harmless, unlike zeolites, so ZIFs are currently being looked into for everything from industrial catalysis to drug delivery. The specific MOF I work with contains zinc nodes and imidazole linkers, dubbed ZIF-8, since it was the 8th ZIF discovered.
Zif-8 has an amazing property: if you add a protein to the synthesis reaction, the crystal actually incorporates the protein into its structure, and the protein can stay folded in its native structure. In addition to this, the MOF actually protects the protein from harsh environments.</p>
<h4>So, what do you study?</h4>
<p>The really cool thing about ZIF-8 is that slight adjustments to the synthesis reaction, like adding in soaps or proteins, can cause the shape of the final material, and therefore the function, to drastically change. My work is specifically concerned with encapsulating enzymes (proteins that catalyze chemical reactions) into MOFs, and checking the activity of different shapes and structures of the resulting material.
I use basic synthesis methods to produce protein-MOFs, and then I use advanced measurement techniques (Diffraction and imaging) to assign the structure/shape, and I finally measure the activity of the enzyme within the MOF. For the last year and change, I've been essentially self-sufficient as my graduate student mentor started working remotely. She entrusted me to perform all her wet lab work, and I did well enough that I'm a key contributor on multiple
Patterson Lab papers, in recognition of the work I've done, both theoretically and physically. I've helped the lab with ideas, found some new things, and contributed to literature reviews on subjects that I could have only dreamed about working on a couple of years ago. Working in the lab is a dream </p>
<h4>A typical day in the life of me (In the lab)</h4>

A bottle of bright orange reagent sits in the back, directly to its left is used pipette tips and a fresh box of those tips."

    <p>
        Fortunately (or unfortunately), there is no one "day in the life" for me at the Patterson Lab. One of my favorite things about working in science is that every day is a miniature problem or crisis that you have to solve. I thrive in high-stress environments, and the lab is no exception.

        <strong>However, </strong> I CAN give you a list of the projects I've been involved in! I have:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Encapsulated enzymes (proteins which catalyze reactions) into MOFs to make a bio-</li>
        <li>Characterized MOF-Enzyme biocomposites using XRD, SEM, and FTIR</li>
        <li>Written python scripts to automate data analysis and figure generation for lab purposes</li>
        <li>Worked with proteins found in COVID-19, proteins involved in cancer diagnosis and treatment, diabetes tests, and detoxification of oxidizing waste</li>
        <li>Developed my own project involving carbon capture into MOF systems using protein-CO<sub>2</sub> interactions</li>
    </ul>
<p>I plan to become a professor in the future, because it's my dream to lead my own research lab and teach people the things I enjoy learning about. One of the great things about science is that the field is becoming more and more interdisciplinary, so I'm not going to limit myself to one area of study. I'm going to study what I want to, and right now that's chemical biology and biochemistry, specifically protein surface interactions and bottom-up protein design. So that's basically it!</p>
