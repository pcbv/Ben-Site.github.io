<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Ben Rose! I was born and raised in San Francisco, and moved to Southern California for college. I'm currently working in the <a href="https://www.thepattersonlab.com/">Joe Patterson lab</a> at UC Irvine working on material science.</p>
    <p>I like making stuff (food, music, code) and thinking about/noticing stuff in my daily life. I like to think I'm an observant person. <strong>but everyone thinks that, no?</strong> </p>
    <p>It's <time datetime="2024-04-18">April 2024</time> right now and I'm still recovering from the PhD admissions cycle. I'm going to UC Berkeley in the fall, and while I'm excited, it's also hard to look at the big picture. I'm trying to get this website to work as a way to get back on track, and so far it's going great!</p>
