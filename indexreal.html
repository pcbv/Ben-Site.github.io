       <h1>Hello! I'm Ben Rose!</h1>


       <p>You may have seen an old website that I made before, but this is a better one. It doesn't rely on tricks to keep you interested, it doesn't dress up, and most importantly, <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/"><strong>It's how I want it to look.</strong></a>The old one was a nightmare to code and make better, and to be honest learning CSS and HTML was cool, but there were so many challenges that I just chose to start fresh</p>
       <p>This website is organized into two sections, <a href="about.html">about</a> and <a href="posts.html">posts.</a> I post whatever I want! This website could be a journal, or it could not, I don't really know. I think I want to make a Python tool that lets me post whenever I want just by sending a google doc, but that might be a while. Anyways, <strong>Happy browsing!</strong></p>
