<!--YOULL HAVE TO PUT SOME IMAGES HERE THEY GO HARD OF LIKE DOING MUSIC AND STUFF. HERE'S THE PERFECT SPACE FOR A TIMELINE-->
<p>Ever since I've been a kid, I've had a need to scratch my musical itch. When I was a kid, I would play songs with my brother, with him playing "drums" we made out of cardboard boxes or old toys we had.
As I grew, I started to go farther and farther in my musicianship, eventually joining a band and playing all around san francisco under the guidance of the San Francisco Rock Project. Nowadays, I make my own music, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1XjJDgPPNMaumUjImZ6Ik6?si=fNPCWVb4RXKMfK6fLcZHfg" ><strong>and you can check it out here!</strong></a></p>
